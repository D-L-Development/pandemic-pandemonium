// would really like done because its going to drive me nuts
1) get game to pause when you die so that you can't fly back on screen
2) put while loop for engine in source inside a loop to see if player wants to play again instead of closing game
3) put background boxes behind "YOU LOSE!", Highscore, and Score areas to make more prominent
4) fix score keeping to only be for platforms and not all static objects



// For final
1) Add health system for viruses and lives from collecting items
2) Keep up with sets of items you've created
3) make masks give some protection against viruses
4) maybe implement more platforms or things to make you spring up or rockets or something
